      <h1>HELLO</h1>
    </header>

    It all began as a hobby, with a passion for crafting cocktails from my own
    kitchen, and now, every Friday, I bring you a brand-new, beautiful, and
    oh-so-tasty cocktail recipe. The mission is simple: to inspire you to become
    your own mixologist. You don't need a fancy bar or a long list of
    ingredients to create something magical. Just everyday items and a dash of
    creativity! Join the community for a flavor-packed journey as I show you
    that the art of cocktails is for everyone. Whether you're a seasoned
    cocktail enthusiast or a complete novice, there's always something
    delightful to sip on at #Friday5OClock. It's all about celebrating the joy
    of home mixology, one cocktail at a time. Cheers to making Fridays tastier
    every week!
